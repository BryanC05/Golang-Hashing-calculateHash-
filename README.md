# Go Blockchain Hash (SHA-256) Demo

This is a simple Go program that demonstrates the **core concept of hashing** in a blockchain. It shows how a block's "fingerprint" is generated by combining all its data and running it through the **SHA-256** algorithm.

The main purpose of this project is to visually demonstrate the **"avalanche effect,"** which shows how a tiny, 1-character change in a block's data results in a completely different hash. This is the fundamental principle that makes a blockchain secure and tamper-evident.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1\. Initialize Your Go Module

In your project's directory, run this command to create a `go.mod` file:

```bash
go mod init go-hash-demo
```

### 2\. Run the Program

Execute the `main.go` file. The program will:

1.  Define data for an "Original Block."
2.  Calculate its SHA-256 hash.
3.  Define data for a "Tampered Block" with a tiny 1-character change.
4.  Calculate its hash and show the difference.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
go run .
```

## 📄 Example Output

```
--- Blockchain Hash Demonstration ---

--- Original Block ---
Data:       Send 10 BTC to Bob
Nonce:      12345
Hash:       8c1b719001b6e4e59f8b41e6c98a5823158e0a112e4f0d6c9b3f3b1b3b1b3b1b

--- Tampered Block (Tiny Change) ---
Data:       Send 10 BTC to B0b
Nonce:      12345
Hash:       a7f2a9c3b1d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0

--- Conclusion ---
Hashes are identical: false
Notice how a tiny 1-character change in the data
results in a completely different hash.
This is what makes the blockchain secure and tamper-evident.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

The `calculateHash` function is the heart of this project. It performs the following steps:

1.  **Concatenates Data:** It combines all the block's data (Timestamp, Data, Previous Hash, and Nonce) into a single, long string.
2.  **Uses SHA-256:** It feeds this string into the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
3.  **Generates a "Fingerprint":** It produces a unique 64-character hexadecimal string. As demonstrated, changing even one character in the input (`Bob` -\> `B0b`) produces a completely different hash, making tampering obvious.
